Describe Methodology, what worked as well as further improvements.

Goal/Objective: Given a question from quora, classify question into topics. Return top 10 topics ordered by probability.

Methodology: 
1) Modeled this problem as a multi-label problem, since each questions could belong to one ore more topics.
2) For the questions text, determined frequency of terms. How often these terms occured and how often they were associated with certain topics.  i.e ( term: Father, topic: Lifestyle)
3) Classification technique: Used Support Vector Classification. This seemed to better results than Naive Bayesian

Results:
1) Returned top topics ( or multi topics) that correlate to the questions

Suggestion for further improvements:
1) Features 
    i) Other than term frequency what was useful? Number of phrases? terms that are made of one or more words? 
2) Modeling
    i) Cross-validation.
    ii)Other techniques
    iii)Returning top 10 labels
3) Performance
    i) Scoring methodology. Rate of classification? How would I score this? Based on number of topics correctly classified?
